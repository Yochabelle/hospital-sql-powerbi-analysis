 Hospital SQL & Power BI Analysis Project

This project analyzes hospital inpatient discharge data using SQL and Power BI. It explores patterns in length of stay (LOS), total costs, severity levels, diagnoses, and hospital performance. The project demonstrates intermediate SQL querying skills and intermediate Power BI dashboard design.

## Project Structure
/sql  
    → SQL queries used for analysis  

/data  
    → Source dataset (CSV)  

/documentation  
    → Full project documentation with detailed insights  

/Power Bi  
    → Power BI healthcare dashboard and dashboard overview  

## SQL Questions Answered
1. Which race has the highest total cost?  
2. Which gender has the highest average length of stay?  
3. What surgery is most common, and which gender undergoes it most?  
4. Which severity level has the highest average cost?  

## SQL Insights Summary
- White patients show the highest recorded total cost.  
- Women have the highest average length of stay.  
- Osteoarthritis surgery is most common, mostly among women.  
- Extreme severity cases have the highest average cost.  

## Power BI Dashboard – Questions Answered
- What is the average inpatient length of stay statewide?  
- Which hospitals have the longest and shortest LOS?  
- What factors increase or decrease LOS?  
- What is the average cost per discharge?  
- Which hospitals are the most and least expensive?  
- Does longer LOS always mean higher cost?  
- What drives cost differences across regions?  
- What are the top diagnosis categories per hospital?  
- How do severity and mortality levels vary by hospital?  
- How are patients discharged (home, rehab, skilled nursing)?  

## Power BI Insights Summary
- LOS varies widely across facilities.  
- Severity of illness strongly affects LOS.  
- Extreme severity cases produce the highest costs.  
- LOS and cost are related but not perfectly linear.  
- Some hospitals consistently outperform others despite high volume.  

## Tools Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL)  
- Power BI  
- Excel (initial inspection)

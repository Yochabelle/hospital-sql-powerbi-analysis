Q1. Which race has the highest total cost?

White patients show the highest total_costs.
This does not imply causation — missing variables like insurance, procedure complexity, and hospital type limit interpretation.

Q2. Which gender has the highest average length of stay?

Women have slightly higher average LOS.
The dataset cannot confirm clinical reasons; more data is needed.

Q3. What surgery is most common, and which gender undergoes it most?

Osteoarthritis surgeries occur the most.
Women undergo these procedures more frequently.
This matches external trends but cannot be explained solely from this dataset.

Q4. Which severity level has the highest average hospital cost?

Extreme severity cases have the highest average cost.
Expected due to resource intensity, but cost drivers cannot be isolated from this dataset.

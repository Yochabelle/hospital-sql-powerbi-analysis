Which severity level has the highest average total_costs?

SELECT 
    apr_severity_of_illness_description AS severity,
    AVG(total_costs) AS avg_total_costs
FROM hospital_hip_discharges
GROUP BY apr_severity_of_illness_description
ORDER BY avg_total_costs DESC
LIMIT 1;
OR
SELECT severity, AVG (total_costs) AS avg_total_costs
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT apr_severity_of_illness_description AS severity, total_costs
FROM hospital_hip_discharges
GROUP BY total_costs,apr_severity_of_illness_description 
) AS Temp_table
GROUP BY severity
ORDER BY avg_total_costs DESC
LIMIT 1

Insight:
 Extreme severity cases produce the highest average costs, as expected due to complexity.
